# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
After understanding the basics of java coding I have created a project called -  Tic-Tac-Toe game. 
In this game, one human player and one AI player can go head-to-head in the classic battle of Xs and Os. 
I've learned so much about user input validation, game state management, types of loops and use of arrays.
